% INPUT ARGUMENTS
%
% lambda    % vector of eigenvalues of the spatial covariance matrix of
%             ambisonic signals
%
% OUTPUT ARGUMENTS
%
% K         % the number of detected sources in the mixtures
% obfunc    % the values of the SORTE criteria for the different source
%             numbers - its minimum indicates theestimated source number
