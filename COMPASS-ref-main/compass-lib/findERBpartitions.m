% INPUT ARGUMENTS
%
% bandfeqs      % center frequencies of STFT bins or filterbank bands
% maxFreqLim    % upper frequency to stop partitioning - the rest of
%                 bins/bands are partitioned into a last region up to Nyquist
%
% OUTPUT ARGUMENTS
%
% erb_idx       % the bin indices of each ERB region
% erb_freqs     % the upper frequency of each ERB region
